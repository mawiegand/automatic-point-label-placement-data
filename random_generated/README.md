# Random Data Set

This folder contains test data which have been generated by the included
*random.rb* ruby scipt. There are two types of data - dense and widely.
The dense type is small region with many points and the widely type is a large
area with few points.

The filename contains the used parameters with values seperated by underscore.

## Generator description
The generator places an amount of points (given by parameter) in a restricted
area randomly. The area size can be configured by the sizeX and sizeY parameters
(see next section). The label length and height is also randomly generated
between 1 and given label length/height. The label description is a randomly
generated string which lengths is random (between 1 and given max length) as
well.

### Usage
    $ ./random.rb --pointCount=1000 --outputFileName=generated_points.txt

### Parameters with type and initial value
- name: pointCount, type: int, default: 1000 // amount of points
- name: sizeX, type: string, default: 'out.txt' // output file name
- name: sizeX, type: int, default: 1000 // absolute max value of pos. and neg. X-Axis
- name: sizeY, type: int, default: 1000 // absolute max value of pos. and neg. Y-Axis
- name: sizeL, type: int, default: 30 // max value of label length
- name: sizeH, type: int, default: 10 // max value of label height
- name: maxLabelNameLength, type: int, default: 12 // max count character count of description
