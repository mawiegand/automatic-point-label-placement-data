This folder contains test data which have been extracted with the attached
javascript snippet from the [website](http://www-lehre.inf.uos.de/~ainf/2016/foto/index.html)

## Data settings:

  (descriptions must not contain spaces)
- The label height is fixed.
- The label width is generated by calculating _description length*2 + 4_
